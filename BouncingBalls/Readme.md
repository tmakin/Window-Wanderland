# Window Wonderland : Bouncing Balls
An experiment in projection mapping on a budget using Proccesing for Window Wonderland 2020.
https://www.windowwanderland.com/

Demo: https://youtu.be/2U7SH3tuiFY

## Objective
Create a dynamic projection mapped window display quickly and cheaply. 
Processing is a great tool for hacking around with dynanmic visuals, and robust enough to 
leave playing for hours on end without crashing.

## Notes
The code contains a quite a few unused elements, such as experiements with different shapes.
I tried out various things including circles, squares, hearts but ended up 
settling with pentagons as they look good when they spin.
